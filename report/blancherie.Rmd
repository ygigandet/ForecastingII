#### **Blancherie Station **

As we can see on the graphs below, it does not seem to have any patterns.
```{r}
blancherie_wednesdays_bikes %>% 
  autoplot(Number) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(54,198,342,486,630,774,918,1062), linetype="dotted") + #Per day
  ggtitle("Wednesdays time series - Bike - Blancherie") +
  labs(x = "Time [10']",
       y = "Number")

```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Is it white noise for the bike at the blancherie? 
blancherie_wednesdays_bikes %>% 
  ACF(Number, lag_max = 144) %>% 
  autoplot() +  ggtitle("Bike")

# Is our time series stationary or not? #We confirm it with the test
blancherie_wednesdays_bike %>% features(Number, unitroot_kpss) 

#The p-value of 0.01 indicates strong evidence to 
#reject the null hypothesis of stationarity.

```
